 * When an object implements this interface, it is assumed to contain {@link ByteBuffer}s, which are not {@link Serializable}, but

 * buffers to the layer below, or to obtain its byte buffers from the layer below. This mechanism may also provide a fast path for
 * direct byte buffers. Constellation enables this interface for {@link Event events} and {@link Activity activities}. When
 * constellation serializes an event or activity, after serialization it will call {@link #pushByteBuffers(List)} to obtain any
 * ByteBuffers to be transferred, and transfer them. On the other side, it will, after deserialization, call
 * {@link #popByteBuffers(List)} to pop the corresponding ByteBuffers from the list.
